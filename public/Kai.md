# Kai
Kai is a simple wrapper for (at the moment only) Groq api requests. It leverages the streaming mode of groqs endpoints to show results quickly, and provides a simple to use builder system for interfacing with the api.

## Features
- Data Streaming
- Tool Calls
- Recursive Tool Calls
- Context preserving

Special thanks to Groq for providing their free tier models for testing this project.
