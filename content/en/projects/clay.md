title: Clay
tagline: A documentation framework that drops into an existing repository.
tier: flagship
order: 2
why: A complete toolchain I designed and maintain under its own organisation. A Vue and Nuxt frontend plus a Go CLI that turns a folder of Markdown into a deployable site.
built:
  problem: "Most documentation tools want a project to adopt a static site generator and its build."
  solution: "The Clay frontend ships prebuilt and reads everything it needs at runtime from two files: clay.yaml, written by hand, and clay-structure.yaml, which Clay Oven, a Go CLI, generates by scanning docs/. A repository only adds Markdown and a config file."

Documentation lives in `docs/` as plain Markdown. Clay Oven scans it, writes the navigation structure and bundles it with a prebuilt Clay frontend. One `clay.yaml` sets title, navbar, languages and landing page.
